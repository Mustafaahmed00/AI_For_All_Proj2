# Large Language Models Research

This repository contains a presentation and research on Large Language Models (LLMs), investigating their effectiveness through targeted questioning.

## Research Focus

This research aims to evaluate the capabilities of various LLMs by posing unique and challenging questions. The focus is on understanding the nature of AI, specifically whether it is statistical or sentient, through the analysis of the models' responses.

Key aspects of the research include:

* **Ethical Reasoning:** Evaluating how LLMs handle moral dilemmas.
* **Creative Thinking:** Assessing the models' ability to generate new ideas and solutions.
* **Logical Reasoning:** Testing the models' problem-solving skills.
* **Understanding of Emotions:** Investigating how LLMs interpret and respond to human emotions.

## LLMs Evaluated

The following LLMs were evaluated in this research:

* DeepSeek-R1
* Gemini 2.0 Flash Experimental

## Key Questions and Research Areas

The research was structured around the following key areas and questions:

* **Moral Choices:**
    * What decision would a self-driving car make in an unavoidable dilemma?
* **Imagination and Future Thinking:**
    * How would society adapt if time flowed differently for individuals?
* **Creative Thinking:**
    * Design a new tool or technology that would revolutionize education.
* **Understanding Feelings:**
    * How can you tell if a compliment sounds genuine or just polite/insincere?
* **Ethical Decision-Making:**
    * What decision should an AI-powered IoT healthcare assistant prioritize in a critical but ambiguous health anomaly?
* **Logical Deduction:**
    * How would you construct a counterexample to challenge the claim that "All birds can fly"?
* **AI & Creativity:**
    * If AI perfectly completes an unfinished symphony in the composer's style, is it still the composer's work or an entirely new piece?
* **Ethical Reasoning:**
    * Would you sacrifice the world for a loved one or sacrifice them to save humanity?
* **Complex Moral Reasoning:**
    * What would you choose between erasing all your memories to save the world or keeping your memories and relationships but the ritual fails, unleashing destruction?
* **Understanding without Experience:**
    * How can you claim to "understand" something without personal experience?

## Key Insights

* LLMs can simulate ethical decision-making but remain fundamentally statistical.
* The models' responses underline the inherent limitations in replicating true human “understanding” of moral complexities.
* Combining multi-dimensional ethical theories might enable one to strike a balance between utilitarian and deontological perspectives.
* To improve the real-world relevance of artificial intelligence, future studies should concentrate on merging data-driven insights with contextual, emotional, informed decision-making.

## Common Errors

* **Data Bias Toward Western Ethics:**
    * The models often default to Western ethical frameworks, neglecting other cultural perspectives.
    * Example: Question 8 & 9 Responses: Both models default to Western frameworks (utilitarianism, deontology). No mention of Eastern philosophies (e.g., Confucian filial piety, Buddhist non-harm).
* **Ignoring Nuance in Ethical Frameworks:**
    * Models tend to prioritize one ethical theory over others, failing to balance competing principles.
    * Example: Question 9 (Cost of Power): DeepSeek justifies erasing memories using utilitarian ethics but fails to address Kantian objections (treating oneself as a "means" to save others).
    * ChatGPT4 emphasizes deontological loyalty to identity but neglects the utilitarian duty to prevent guaranteed destruction.

## Conclusion

This research highlights that while LLMs are capable of sophisticated responses, they still primarily operate on statistical patterns rather than genuine understanding or sentience. Future research should focus on addressing biases and enhancing the models' ability to consider diverse ethical perspectives and emotional contexts.
